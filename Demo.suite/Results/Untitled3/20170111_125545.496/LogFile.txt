Leaving a home equipped with a\nTV and a video recorder isn’t an attractive idea on a humid, cold, or rainy night. Even if the\nweather cooperates, there is still a thirty-minute drive to the theater down a congested\nhighway, followed by the hassle of looking for a parking space. And then there are the\nlines. After hooking yourself to the end of a human chain, you worry about whether there\nwill be enough tickets, whether you will get seats together, and whether many people will\nsneak into the line ahead of you.	3	on_untitled3	Untitled3.script
